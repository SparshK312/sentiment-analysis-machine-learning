# Sentiment Analysis Using Text and Audio Transcription

## Project Overview
This project explores sentiment analysis on textual and audio data by analyzing preprocessed news headlines, descriptions, and audio transcripts. The goal is to classify data into positive or negative sentiment categories using Logistic Regression and LSTM models.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and standardizes multiple text datasets to ensure consistency in sentiment analysis.
- **Audio Transcription**: Converts audio data to text using silence-based segmentation and speech recognition, making audio content analyzable.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applies TextBlob for initial sentiment scoring and machine learning models for sentiment classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes model performance visualization with various metrics and distribution plots for insightful evaluation.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SparshK312/sentiment-analysis-machine-learning.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-machine-learning

Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed, then use the following command to install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Access:
The datasets used in this project are currently stored in Google Drive and are not publicly available. To replicate the project, you would need to provide your own datasets or adjust the code to use alternative data sources.

Note: Future versions of this project may include publicly accessible sample data or instructions for data acquisition to facilitate easier replication.

Usage
Since data access is currently limited, you can explore the code to understand the steps for text and audio-based sentiment analysis. If you have your own data, place it in the appropriate format and update the data paths in the code to match your data locations.

Future Improvements
Public Data Access: A future update will include sample data or provide instructions to access publicly available datasets.
Enhanced User Support: A more streamlined setup process will be implemented to make it easier for others to replicate the project.
